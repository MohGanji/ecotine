# BlogFrog

I was working, after a half hour or so, I unconciously opened a new tab, typed in: "twitter.com".
Next thing I know is I'm scrolling down my twitter feed for an hour.
If you thought that's just a one time thing, you couldn't be more wrong.
This is me every day.

There's also another side of me, that likes to read blogs.
There are a lot of interesting people on the internet writing cool stuff in their blogs.
I learn a lot reading those and getting to know those people.
But I never seem to find the time to read these blogs constantly, and deciding which blog to open? Don't even open that door.

So I built [_BlogFrog_](http://blogfrog.xyz).
It's a simple website with one button, that's all.
So now every time I get tired of work, or I want to lose focus, I open _BlogFrog_.
I let the button take me somewhere random on the internet. I read one blog post, learn something, and I get back to work. 
Because there is no infinite scrolling feed after that.

How about you?
Do you waste so much time on social media or online shopping?
Do you unconciously open a new tab and type in instagram/twitter/zara?

Try replacing it with _BlogFrog_.
Next time you want to type in instagram, just type _blogfrog_.
It will get you to a random cool blog post on the internet.
Chances are you will learn something too.
